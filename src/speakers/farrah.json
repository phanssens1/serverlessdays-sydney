        "description": "Weâ€™ve been conditioned over the years to always question whether we can succeed. We tend to focus on all the things that could go wrong instead of the possibilities. The attitude of being ready to work even in the face of challenges and despite odds is what will make all the difference in your life. In this session, you will learn how changing your narrative and focusing on what is possible can have a dramatic effect on both your success at work and your happiness in life. ",

She has worked at multiple startups in many different capacities, eventually working her way to being the Ecosystems Director for Stackery in Portland, Oregon. She is known for not only her ability to get things done but her track-record of accomplishing lofty goals in creative, dynamic ways with an infectious smile. Her passion lies in influencing outcomes and driving projects with multiple stakeholders, priorities, and personalities towards a common goal. She will be the first to tell you how much she loves the chaos and challenges that tech provides. Farrah has shaped a unique story and career that supports her passion for fostering genuine, vibrant communities. She aims to re-define the experience of providing a service with a no bs attitude and lots of compassion. ",
